user_description: >
  I am a Ph.D. student <a href="https://wsp-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">
  @KAIST WSP Lab</a>. My primary research interests lie in the area of finding,
  analyzing, and patching software vulnerabilities. In particular, I am
  interested in automating these steps by leveraging recent advances in machine
  learning. Thus, the intersection of various fields including but not limited
  to computer security, software engineering, and machine learning is of my
  particular interest.
